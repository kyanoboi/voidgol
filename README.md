# voidgol

`voidgol` is an experimental repository for exploring the **Web3D technology stack**, focusing on integrating WebGL with modern frontend frameworks.

---

## Tech Stack

- WebGL / Three.js
- Vue Ecosystem (Vue / Router / Pinia / Vite)
- 3D scene construction & rendering optimization
- Camera control, interaction, and animation
- Web3D engineering practices

---

## Goals

- Serve as a **playground and knowledge base** for Web3D
- Validate different Web3D implementation approaches
- Accumulate reusable 3D scenes and utility abstractions

## Notes

This repository is mainly for **experimentation and exploration**.  
Project structure and implementations may change frequently, and API stability is not guaranteed.
